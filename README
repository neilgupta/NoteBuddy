===NoteBuddy===

Flashcard sharing app for iPad

Create flashcards for each of your courses, and then share these flashcards with other NoteBuddy users in the area over Bluetooth!

This is my first iOS app. I hacked it together in a weekend while learning Objective-C. It is provided as-is with no guarantees or support.
