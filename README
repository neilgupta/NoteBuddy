===NoteBuddy===

Flashcard sharing app for iPad

Create flashcards for each of your courses, and then share these flashcards with other NoteBuddy users in the area over Bluetooth!

This is my first iOS app. I hacked it together in a weekend while learning Objective-C, so I would not recommend using any of this code in another project as there are probably many bugs. It is provided as-is with no guarantees or support.
